# challenge-1

## Description

This is the UW Boot Camp Week 1 Challenge. Student is suppose to refactor the existing code given the scenario of a marketing agency's existing site. The goal is to make it more accessible. 


## Usage

When compare to the original html, the elements now follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning. Accessible alt attributes were added, all the links were checked and modified to function. 

When compare to the original CSS, all the codes are consolidated and comments were made to identify the selectors.

When the webpage is open, it will look the same as the original. But when the html and css sheets are reviewed, they will be different from the original version. The new version will be more well structured.
